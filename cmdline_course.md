# The Command-line Course

The purpose of this course was to introduce the participant to working on the computer in a UNIX environment and using grass root commands on it using bash (i.e. Bourne again shell), which is, to roughly simplify it, a command-line interpreter.
The course offered an overview to what can be accomplished using the command-line, which includes text processing, installing programs and setting up webpages (among other things).

## Week 1

I entered the course having very little to no experience in using bash. The very first thing I needed to accomplish was to download Ubuntu onto my computer, which I did. Applying nano in creating and editing textfiles was a somewhat familiar concept from the introductory course on the previous study period, but I cannot recall e.g. learning the use of wget and, especially, tar commands back then. Compressing a file was troublesome to me at first, but I managed to do it with some assistance of Google. This was the first time I realized how it's actually possible to access one's desktop through the terminal.

## Week 2

Obtaining root rights on bash turned out to be an excellent thing. Through this it'd be possible to modify files that would otherwise be unauthorized to alter. Additionally, I learnt the use of the ssh command. In order to apply it, I had to renew my password on the taito-shell had expired. I got excited about this and tried to get remote access to my parents' computer, but it turned out to be far more complicated than my just using the IP address and the password of their computer.

## Week 3

This week's quiz went by far and overall worse than any other assignment on the course. It was time get back to something that I had a hard time with on the previous course: regular expressions or regex's. We were to obtain information on the frequencies of certain words in certain textfiles. This was the only time I had no second thoughts on going to the lab session as grep commands were extremely fine-tuned in their application.

## Week 4

This week was about developing shell scripts. I further learnt how important a role the ending of a file's name plays its application. Having said this I must admit that, despite the points showing otherwise, this was the most difficult task on the entire course. I cannot with confidence say I learnt to actually do scripts, but I'm sure it's a matter of practice. Also, learning to edit and take advantage of reconfiguration of the .bashrc file was something I found very appealing even though I got the configurations running only after placing at the end of the file.

## Week 5

Installation of programs on bash is what the week's materials were about. Whilst the installation of e.g. Python was already familiar to me via the introductory course, I found the Makefile to be a rather big piece to swallow. The "make" command and its variations were taught. The said command is to re-compile groups of programs.

## Week 6

The content of week 6 revolved around version control as its title indicates. It was a straightforward concept to me; when editing a file, a script or another text/code entity one is able via GitHub to separate branches of working stages (of a project) between which one can decide to progress differently. This way unwished editing can be reversed easily and/or retrieved upon request. Enjoyable I dare say!

## Week 7

I had my doubts about my capabilities on this week's assignments. Our having been introduced to GitHub led to the final assignment, a part of which this section obviously is, too; namely, creating a webpage using GitHub. The importance of file endings came into play as I realized that marked down files can, indeed, be created simply by adding the .md ending to an edited file. I was surprised to understand how effective the use of terminal combined with GitHub was in developing actual webpages. Much remains unclear to me in regard to the course's content, but in good will I can claim having learnt something. Thanks for the course!

## Difficulty (from 1 to 10) of each week's assignments

| Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 | Week 6 |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|   3    |    2   |    8   |   10   |    7   |    5   |

## Some of the skills acquired

* Reconfiguring commands through .bashrc

* Using nano to alter functions of a simple script

* Understanding of file endings
